# My Practice catkin workspaces
This repo consists of four main catkin workspaces that I created and used to learn ROS and Moveit
## Content description
* maze-solver_ws - Catkin workspace created for maze solver robot
* moveit_ws - Catkin workspace created to learn moveit
* my_maze_models - maze models created to insert in Gazebo
* refr_learns - Catkin workspace created to implement my ROS learnings
* wanderbot_ws - Catkin workspace created for obstracle avoidance robot
* ros_with_cpp - Catkin workspace created to practice code on C++
* cpp_revisit_ws - Catkin workspace created to practice C++ from different material
* robot_modeling_ws - Catkin workspace created to learn about 3D modeling in ROS
* results - Directory containing the results of the projects
## Seven DOF manipulator
A custom made seven degrees of freedom manipulator using freeCAD and MeshLab whose moveit configuration package is available in robot_modeling_ws workspace under the name of penguin_moveit_config. Mesh files required for the package is available in robot_description_pkg of the same workspace.
The final result of the arm is shown in the below video.
